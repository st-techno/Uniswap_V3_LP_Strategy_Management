## Uniswap V3 - Liquidity Provisioning (LP)

## Dynamic Risk Management:
Monitors the price of the pool's assets.
Removes liquidity if the price drops below a lower threshold to reduce exposure.
Adds liquidity if the price rises above an upper threshold to maximize returns.

## Automated Monitoring:
The main() function runs an infinite loop to monitor and manage liquidity dynamically at regular intervals.

## Liquidity Buffer:
Uses a configurable LIQUIDITY_BUFFER to determine how much liquidity to add or remove dynamically.

## Error Handling:
Includes error handling for API calls and transactions to ensure robustness.

## Customizable Thresholds:
You can adjust LOWER_THRESHOLD, UPPER_THRESHOLD, and LIQUIDITY_BUFFER based on your specific strategy.

## Prerequisites
Replace placeholders like YOUR_INFURA_OR_ALCHEMY_URL, YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS, YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, and YOUR_TOKEN_ID with actual values.
